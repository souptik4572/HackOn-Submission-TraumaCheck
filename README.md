# TraumaCheck
Is your mental health is affected by your workplace environment? Let's find out...!

## Inspiration
Due to this COVID-19 pandemic, we are currently noticing a large number of mental health breakdowns especially in people working from home. So, we decided to build a project that would let people know whether their mental health is interfering with their workplace performance.

## What it does
This app takes some basic inputs from the user and analyses them through a pre-trained Machine Learning model to predict whether their mental health is interfering with their workplace performance.

## How we built it
- Gathered data regarding mental health from Kaggle
- Trained various Machine Learning Models and calculated their accuracy
- Choose our Random Forest Classifier model as the best one
- Made an API server with FastAPI for processing data and wrapping our model
- Built a Typeform-like form using React to gather user inputs

## Challenges we ran into
- Choosing a Machine Learning model with high enough accuracy
- Building an API server for our model
- Choosing memes that can make people smile :)
- Tailoring React libraries for our needs

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully overcame all the above-mentioned challenges and that's our biggest accomplishment! We also learnt how to train and deploy a Machine Learning model on a production server.

## What we learned
- A lot about python backend API microservices
- Connecting a Machine Learning model with an API server for easy access from any sort of frontend framework
- Reading open source code base and trying to modify/contribute

## What's next for TraumaCheck
- We'll try to suggest some solutions which will help people overcome mental health issues through the same app.
- We'll try to implement an Unsupervised dynamic Machine Learning model in future.
